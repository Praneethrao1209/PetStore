This is a standalone application where I defined three APIS to implement the functionaly mentioned in problem statement
We have used listed data stracture to actually store the entries of petstore as an inmoemory datatabse

I used  one of the GET api to get all the entries of the petstore
I sued POST api to store entries into petstore
I also use GET api to get any entry of petstore by ID

I HAve used JUNIT test cases to mock the data and assert the functionality of implemetnted APIs
I  used springboot here and defined controllers and services to extend the functioanlity of APIs.
